# Pre-work: Proxy-Server

This is a Proxy Server for Node.js submitted as the [pre-work](http://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_nodejs/prework) requirement for CodePath.

Time spent: 6 hours to setup the environment. 2 hours to build the proxy server.

Completed:

* [] Required: Requests to port `8000` are echoed back with the same HTTP headers and body
* [] Required: Requests/reponses are proxied to/from the destination server
* [] Required: The destination server is configurable via the `--host`, `--port`  or `--url` arguments
* [] Required: The destination server is configurable via the `x-destination-url` header
* [] Required: Client requests and respones are printed to stdout
* [] Required: The `--logfile` argument outputs all logs to the file specified instead of stdout

Will try in next version:

* [] Optional: The `--exec` argument proxies stdin/stdout to/from the destination program
* [] Optional: The `--loglevel` argument sets the logging chattiness
* [] Optional: Supports HTTPS
* [] Optional: `-h` argument prints CLI API

## Starting the Server

```bash
bode index.js

L-SB80M9FFT4-M:proxy-server sqazi$ bode index.js
```

## Features

### Echo Server:

```bash
curl -v -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000 -d "hello self" -H "x-asdf: yodawg"

L-SB80M9FFT4-M:proxy-server sqazi$ curl -v -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8lo self" -H "x-asdf: yodawg"
* Rebuilt URL to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/

hello self
```

### Proxy Server:

Echo Server: Port 8000
Proxy Server: Port 8001
Port 8001 will proxy to the echo server on port 8000.

Echo request: 
{"host":"127.0.0.1:8000","user-agent":"curl/7.43.0","accept":"*/*","x-asdf":"yodawg","content-length":"10","content-type":"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"}hello self
